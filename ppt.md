# Type of project / description

We have launched a new bus line within the Community of Madrid that connects various neighborhoods with a range of leisure destinations across the city. This service is designed to improve access to popular entertainment venues, parks, and cultural attractions, making it easier for both residents and visitors to experience all that Madrid has to offer. With convenient stops and frequent schedules, our bus line aims to provide a reliable and enjoyable transportation option for those looking to explore the city's vibrant social scene. Passengers will have access to real-time information about bus schedules and routes through multiple channels, including bus stop displays, our website, and the mobile app.

# Assumptions of the system

---- zones we cover, and how many stops we have ---------

--- number of people we can transport in a day, 48 people is the capacity os the bus --- The average number of passengers per trip will be sufficient to justify the operation of each bus, as we believe it will effectively accommodate the demand from passengers interested in visiting various leisure destinations.

- Tickets can be purchased online or directly on the bus. This means that ticket reservations can only be made online, as we do not have a bus station where tickets can be bought.

- The buses will transmit information to the control center at regular intervals. This scheduled communication will ensure that the control center maintains a constant flow of real-time data regarding the location and operational status of each bus in the fleet.

- The traffic management system will be capable of identifying and predicting delays caused by traffic in real time. This functionality will enable the control center to make necessary adjustments to routes and schedules, ensuring that service remains efficient and reliable for all passengers. By proactively addressing potential delays, the system can enhance the overall travel experience and minimize disruption to the bus schedule. Additionally, the system will be equipped to modify routes in response to roadworks, public events or demonstrations, allowing for seamless adaptation to changing traffic conditions.

- It is assumed that the 4G network coverage will be sufficient along the entire bus route to enable continuous communication between the bus and the control center, as we will be operating in areas within the Community of Madrid. This reliable coverage will ensure uninterrupted connectivity at all times, which is also essential for processing card payments and mobile transactions.

- The system will be capable of handling adverse weather conditions and that specific protocols will be implemented to ensure the safety of passengers and drivers in these situations.

- Each bus will undergo regularly scheduled preventive maintenance, thereby minimizing the risk of mechanical failures during operation.
