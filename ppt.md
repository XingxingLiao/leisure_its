## Functional Requirements
- Multi-Modal Transport Integration: The system must provide options for various transport modes (metro, buses, taxis,
  bike-sharing) to facilitate seamless transitions between them.
- Real-Time Information:Users must receive up-to-date information about transport schedules, availability, and delays
  via a mobile application and website.
- Real-Time Alerts:Send notifications to users about transport delays, route changes, or special promotions for leisure
  activities.
- Data Analytics and Reporting:Implement data analytics tools to track user behavior, popular routes, and leisure
  activity preferences for future planning.
- Interactive Maps:Provide interactive maps with transport routes, leisure attractions, and points of interest to help
  users navigate the city.
- Booking and Payment System:The platform should enable users to book and pay for transport services and entry tickets
  to leisure activities in a single transaction.
- User Profiles and Preferences:Users should be able to create profiles to save preferences, previous trips, and
  favorite leisure destinations
- Emergency Services Integration:Ensure that the system includes features for users to contact emergency services or
  report issues while using transport services.
- Necessary information for the user: bus station, frequency, schedule, stops, etc.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Language Support:Offer multilingual support for the mobile application and website to cater to international
  visitors.
- Privacy and Data Protection:Ensure that user data is protected through secure data storage, encryption, and compliance
  with data protection regulations.
- Integration with Payment Gateways: Support multiple payment options, including credit cards, mobile wallets, and
  contactless payments, for booking transport services and leisure activities.

## Domain Requirements
- Compliance with Local Regulations: All transport services must comply with local transportation laws and safety
  regulations.
- Emergency Response Planning: Develop protocols for responding to emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters within
  the transport system to ensure user safety and service continuity.

## Quality Requirements
- Performance and Scalability:The system should handle high volumes of users, especially during peak tourist seasons,
  without performance degradation.
- Usability:The mobile application and website must have an intuitive user interface, ensuring easy navigation and quick
  access to services.
- Reliability:Transport services should maintain a high level of reliability with minimal downtime, especially during
  operational hours.
- Security:User data must be protected through robust security measures, including encryption for payment processing and
  personal information.
- Maintainability: The system should be designed for easy updates and maintenance to incorporate user feedback and new
  features.
- Data Accuracy: Ensure that all information related to transport schedules, availability, and leisure activities is
  accurate and updated regularly.
- Compliance: The system must comply with data protection laws, privacy regulations, and accessibility standards to
  ensure user trust and legal compliance. Implement privacy features such as data anonymization, consent management, and
  user control over personal information to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize system performance through caching, load balancing, and other techniques to ensure
  fast response times and efficient resource utilization.
- Accessibility Compliance: Ensure that the system meets accessibility standards such as WCAG to provide equal access to
  users with disabilities.
- Security Compliance: Implement security best practices such as encryption, authentication, and authorization to
  protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Sensor Integration: Integrate with sensors and IoT devices to collect real-time data on traffic conditions, weather
  patterns, and user behavior to optimize transport services and improve user experience.
